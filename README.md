# Mockup Sign In Page

## Overview
This project is a mockup sign in page, designed for demonstration purposes. It is a simple HTML form that takes user information including first name, last name, email, phone number, and password. When you click the "Create Account" button, it will console log the form results.

Please note that this form is purely for mockup purposes. It is not connected to any backend or database, so the information you input will not be saved or used anywhere.
